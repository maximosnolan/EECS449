## Meeting 1 

# Ideas:

## Help people find new jobs in tech based on their skillsets

+ Would ask person where they want to live, what languages they use, etc.
+ Would provide a description of a job and ask if they like it
+ If not, what part did they not like (remove attributes from potential jobs)
+ Finally produce a list of jobs with salaries and email it to them

## Financial Assistant

+ Would ask people for their salary, COL, etc. and store this in a DB (probably)
+ Person would ask can I make x expense and the AI would respond with why or why not, and give them projections 

## Alexa Whose at the door?
